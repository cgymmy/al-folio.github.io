Hi! :smile: My name is Guanyu Chen(陈冠宇). I am currently in my first year of PhD at [College of IC, Zhejiang University](https://ic.zju.edu.cn/main.htm), under the supervision of Professor [Dong Ni](https://person.zju.edu.cn/nidong). I completed my B.S. degree in [Mathematics and Applied Mathematics (Plan for strengthening basic disciplines), Zhejiang University](http://www.math.zju.edu.cn/api2017/index.psp). 

I keep my research interest focused on **Multiscale Systems**, with a particular focus on both their theoretical foundations and practical applications. Theoratically, microscopic system is consist of particles, which includes **Data, Neuron, iron, etc**, while macroscopic system describes the whole field which includes **Data Manifold, Neural Network, Plasma field, etc**.


<!-- The study of **Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs)** is integral to this research, as it underpins much of the theoretical framework required for analyzing multiscale systems.

Cause you know in the process of **IC manufacturing**, etching, deposition and other processes are involved, which is a classic multiscale system. So my primary research interest lies in understanding the **asymptotic behavior** of these systems, with a strong emphasis on the theories of **mean-field** and **homogenization**. These frameworks provide essential tools for conducting a more comprehensive analysis of multiscale phenomena across various scales.

Normally, **Multiscale systems** typically involve both **temporal** and **spatial scales**, which are often interdependent. Spatially, the scales range from the **microscopic** (atomic) level to the **macroscopic** (fluid) level. In **microscopic systems**, large particles move follow **Brownian motion** due to collisions of smaller particles, which can be described using **Stochastic Ordinary Differential Equation (SODE)**. As the number of particles tends to infinity, the behavior of the system can be captured by **Stochastic Partial Differential Equation (SPDE)**. When the randomness of the system stabilizes, it can be described by a **Partial Differential Equation (PDE)**, which describe the macroscopic phenomena.

My research aims to rigorously investigate the progression from **microscopic** to **macroscopic** scales through the application of **asymptotic analysis**, a method that aligns closely with the principles of **mean-field theory**. This approach has the potential to be extended beyond physical systems, offering a valuable perspective for the analysis of **neural networks**. By conceptualizing each neuron as a particle, I seek to explore how the propagation of signals within a network may be understood through analogous principles.

The study of **Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs)** is integral to this research, as it underpins much of the theoretical framework required for analyzing multiscale systems. I am actively pursuing advanced studies in this area, with the goal of leveraging these insights to contribute to the development of **diffusion models**.

Prior to this, I conducted research on the integration of classical numerical algorithms with **Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs)**. However, I have come to recognize that the potential for further development of PINN-based methods is somewhat constrained. As a result, I have developed a keen interest in exploring the construction of more effective **Neural Operators**, as I believe that, in many aspects such as flexibility, neural operators offer distinct advantages over PINNs. -->
